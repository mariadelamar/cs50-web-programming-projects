# CS50 Web Programming Projects

Some of my projects from "CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". Harvard’s in-depth course on designing and building web applications using Python, JavaScript, and SQL. This course expands on CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science, diving deeper into full-stack development with frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap.
