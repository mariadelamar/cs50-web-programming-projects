# 🌍 Google Search Front-End  

This project is a front-end implementation of **Google Search**, **Google Image Search**, and **Google Advanced Search** using HTML forms. By analyzing Google's URL structure, we learn how search queries are processed through **GET parameters**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔎 **Google Search** – A simple search form that submits queries to Google.  
- 🖼️ **Image Search** – A dedicated page for searching Google Images.  
- ⚙️ **Advanced Search** – Allows users to refine searches with multiple parameters.  

## 🔍 How It Works  
- Google’s search URL follows this structure: search?q=your_query
- The `q` parameter is the essential part of the search query.  
- This project creates an HTML interface that submits form data directly to Google's search engine.  

## 📌 Learning Outcomes  
- Understanding **HTML forms** and GET requests.  
- Exploring **query strings** and URL parameters.  
- Building a functional search front-end using only HTML.  

💡 *This project reinforces core web development concepts while recreating a familiar user experience.*
