# eBay-like Auction Site

This is my solution to an assignment from Harvard Universityâ€™s CS50 course, 'CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript,' where we had to design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site using Django.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Auction Listings:** Users can create auction listings with a title, description, starting bid, image URL, and category.
- **Place Bids:** Users can place bids on auction listings, with the bid needing to be higher than any previous bids.
- **Comment on Listings:** Users can comment on auction listings, providing additional details or feedback.
- **Watchlist:** Signed-in users can add listings to their personal watchlist and easily access them later.
- **Active Listings Page:** View all active auction listings with details like title, description, current price, and image.
- **Listing Pages:** Each listing has its own page displaying all details, including current bid status, and allows bidding and commenting.
- **Categories:** Users can view listings by categories such as Fashion, Electronics, Home, etc.
- **Admin Interface:** Django admin interface for managing listings, bids, and comments.
